                <h2>Preface</h2>
<p>The increased number of heart disease and stroke cases has emerged as a major public health concern, which has necessitated immediate lifestyle modification. With urbanization and altered dietary habits, many people are at greater risk of developing conditions such as high blood pressure, diabetes, and obesity, which can lead to cardiovascular diseases. Cardiovascular disease, which consists largely of ischaemic heart disease and stroke, is the leading cause of death globally, and the World Health Organization (WHO) estimates show that India alone contributes slightly more than a fifth of these deaths.</p>
<p>A study estimates <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">stroke to account for approximately 1/4th of cardiovascular deaths in India</span></strong>; approximately 0.4 million of the 1.3 million cardiovascular deaths in the 30-69-year-old group have been attributed to stroke. The statistics thus demands urgent and effective preventive measures. Embracing a heart-healthy lifestyle will significantly help in bringing down the risks of conditions related to heart health. The WHO lays down that up to 80% of all premature heart attacks and strokes can be avoided through effective public health policies and individual lifestyle changes.</p>
<p><strong><em>While an overall healthy lifestyle can be the best shield for a healthy heart, here are a few lifestyle modifications that can significantly help prevent heart stroke or delay its onset:</em></strong></p>
<h2><strong>Being Physically Active</strong></h2>
<p>Daily activity lowers the risk for heart disease. Physical activity will help with weight control and can lower the possibility of having other conditions that may strain the heart - high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and type 2 diabetes among them. 30-45 min of physical activity 3 to 4 times a week is associated with cardiovascular health benefits. Simple activities like gardening, cleaning the house, climbing up the stairs, or walking the dog can also be beneficial.</p>
<h2><strong>Stress Management</strong></h2>
<p>Chronic stress may also cause high blood pressure and other risk factors for heart disease. Some people cope with stress in unhealthy ways. For example, they may overeat, drink, or smoke. People can boost health by finding other ways of managing stress. Healthy coping strategies include exercise, relaxation techniques, mindfulness, yoga, and meditation. Chronic stress may be associated with mental health conditions such as anxiety and depression – the same conditions that also have ties to heart disease risk factors, including high blood pressure and decreased blood flow to the heart.</p>
<h2><strong>Heart-healthy Diet</strong></h2>
<p>Healthy eating might be the best weapon against heart disease. The food we eat can affect other factors within our control, like cholesterol, blood pressure, blood sugar, and weight. It is recommended to take a diet that is healthy and consists mostly of vegetables, fruits, and whole-grain products. To keep one’s weight steady, one should balance daily calorific intake with physical activity that burns calories commensurately.</p>
<h2><strong>Quality Sleep</strong></h2>
<p>During slumber, the heart rate and blood pressure usually take a dip, thus providing the cardiovascular system a well-deserved respite from the stresses of the day. The nightly fall, in fact, is one of the cardinal needs for a healthy heart because it serves to lessen the workload on the heart. Moreover, while short on rest, an individual is more prone to develop several other ailments that lead to heart disease, such as diabetes, a high body mass index (BMI), and high blood pressure.</p>
<h2><strong>Avoiding Tobacco Products</strong></h2>
<p>Maybe one of the best things that work for your heart is to quit smoking or using smokeless tobacco. The risk of heart disease starts to drop as early as one day after quitting. One year after quitting smoking, the risk of heart disease is about half that of a smoker.</p>
<h2>Termini</h2>
<p>In a nutshell, adopting a heart-healthy lifestyle is necessary to prevent strokes and maintain overall cardiovascular health. Making informed choices regarding diet, exercise, and other aspects of lifestyle provides people with an opportunity to markedly reduce their risk of suffering a heart attack or stroke.</p>

            <![CDATA[
                <p>Many might rejoice the decline in temperature, as it means a return to the comfort and snugness of the winter months. However, these cold months pose a serious risk for the heart health and for any individual with pre-existing heart disease, special attention must be paid to heart care. While various factors put extra strain on the cardiovascular system during winter, some studies reveal that the winter <span style="text-decoration: underline;">months see almost 53 per cent more potentially serious heart conditions</span> like heart attacks and strokes than the summer months.</p>
<h2>Constricted blood vessels</h2>
<p>Winter poses unique challenges to heart health, with colder temperatures causing blood vessels to constrict and increasing the workload on the heart. Winter is associated with a higher incidence of cardiovascular events due to the increase in stress that a drop in ambient temperature puts on heart walls and the decrease in flow to the arteries that supply blood to the heart. Moreover, during the winter, people tend to do less physical activity, which can lead to weight gain and a consequent increase in blood pressure and cholesterol levels. Exposure to extreme cold may even result in hypothermia in which body temperature drops to dangerously low levels, thus complicating cardiovascular health even further.</p>
<h2>Sedentary lifestyle and Dehydration</h2>
<p>The increased workload on the heart coupled with lack of physical activities and the consumption of heavier foods put people most at risk for cardiovascular events during the cold months. Protecting the heart from heart diseases during winter months requires an active approach. Primarily during winter, people should dress warm to avoid sudden exposure to cold, which can elevate blood pressure and strain the cardiovascular system. People should also maintain a balanced diet rich in seasonal vegetables, whole grains, and heart-healthy fats while limiting processed and high-fat comfort foods.</p>
<p>Navigating the cold months with a healthy heart require people to stay active and engage in physical activities. With the limitation on outdoor activities, simple indoor workouts such as a home workout or yoga or just walking indoors can facilitate proper blood flow and reduce the level of stress on heart. Hydration and sleep, in turn, are equally significant to the maintenance of a healthy heart. During the winter, the body tends to easily get dehydrated, blood thickens, and the chance of clots increases. So, it is always advised that people should drink enough water even if not thirsty to maintain hydration and not put much pressure on the heart.</p>
<h2>Get regular check-ups</h2>
<p>For those in high-risk groups — such as individuals with health conditions like diabetes, hypertension, or a history of heart disease — regular health checkups and adherence to prescribed medications are vital. Through regular consultations with the doctor, potential health issues can be diagnosed early and people can get timely advice to stay healthy throughout the cold season.</p>
<h2>Avoid stress</h2>
<p>Stress can be another major factor in heart problems during the winter. People should limit stress and set aside time to relax and unwind through simple daily activities like meditating, listening to music or taking a hot shower. It is also noteworthy that the winter is the time for people to stay safe from common illnesses like fever or common flu. Vaccinations like the flu and pneumococcal vaccines can help prevent winter-related infections, which can indirectly strain the heart.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Keeping the heart safeguarded from the cold can make winter a beautiful time of the year for every individual. Not only individuals with pre-existing heart conditions but those prioritizing heart health should also have an understanding on the impact of cold weather on the heart health. By taking certain proactive measures, individuals can significantly reduce the risk of winter-related heart complications and maintain optimal cardiovascular health.</p>

Both had annular/ LVOT calcium mandating accurate device sizing.<br><br>1st patient - 59yo gent, inpatient, admitted with syncope and severe AS with poor LV who flatly refused surgery despite multiple reviews by cardiac surgery. Type 2 bicuspid AV with calcific and fibrotic raphes. Annulus &gt;800mm2, severe annular and LVOT calcium but both measurements in range for nominal volume 32mm Meril Octacor THV. Very difficult BAV - 4 inflations needed to crack the valve. Satisfactory deployment with single digit gradient and mild AR. We were apprehensive of annular/ LVOT injury but thankfully no issues were encountered in what was a tough case. Minimal oversizing due to precise THV prosthesis selection with respect to annular and LVOT dimensions enabled a safe implant in a hostile aortic root - certainly an area of unmet clinical need. <br><br>2nd patient - Type 1 bicuspid AV with a severe calcific raphe. LVOT calcification. Again both annulus and LVOT well in range for nominal volume 30.5mm Meril Octacor THV. Beautiful result with single digit gradient and no AR. <br><br>It’s indeed a privilege that we can offer our patients in South Wales the right TAVI valve prostheses as dictated by their anatomy.

<p>Proud to share that at Swansea Bay we did our first 3 TAVI cases successfully with the new, now commercially available, NAVITOR VISION self expandable intra-annular Transcatheter Heart Valve from Abbott. Glad that we’re able to offer this new technology for the benefit of our 🫀patients in South 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿 <br>The first patient had severe AS with crippling symptoms. Hostile anatomy with a “dagger” of calcium in the LVOT and near circumferential STJ calcium. Legs were challenging too, with RCFA relatively better, but only roughly a 10mm spot available for sheath entry between inferior epigastric artery and beginning of anterior wall calcium. <br>We used a 29mm Navitor Vision THV. The novel three Tantalum markers made positioning, correcting parallax, and deploying the valve accurately, much more easier. No AR on aortogram. Fantastic haemodynamics with no gradient and AR index of 45. No postdilatation needed (which we wanted to avoid at all cost). Excellent closure on DSA.<br>Despite ~5mm implant depth, no change in conduction and patient discharged on D1 with no AR, single digit gradient (MG 3mmHg, DVI 0.69), and narrow QRS.<br>The Navitor Vision THV incorporates a really helpful iteration to the valve, and together with the Flex Nav delivery system, we were able to achieve a great outcome for our patient in a case that was high risk from all angles.<br>Thanks to the entire 🫀 team and excited that we can offer the latest technology to help our patients.</p>
<p>This valve is also available in India now: <a href="https://www.abbott.in/media-center/press-releases/abbott-introduces-navitor-vision-in-india-the-next-generation-of-heart-valve-technology-designed-to-treat-aortic-stenosis.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Abbott Introduces NavitorTM Vision in India</a></p>

<p>Swansea Bay are delighted to be the first NHS centre in the UK to offer the Sapien Ultra RESILIA TAVI (trans-catheter aortic valve implantation) valve. The latest Edwards technology has a new skirt on the largest size to minimise valve leak and a novel treatment of the hand-sewn leaflets designed to preserve valve function over time. Swansea Bay heads the table in the UK audit of access to treatment for the life-threatening condition of aortic stenosis (NICOR) and implanted the first RESILIA in the UK last week, a fantastic addition to the aortic stenosis armoury.<br>🫀💪😎Go Swansea Bay! </p>
