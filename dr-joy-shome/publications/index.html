This study aimed to explore the predictors of requirement for Urg-TAVI versus El-TAVI, as well as compare differences in short- and intermediate-term mortality.<br><br>This single-centre, retrospective cohort study investigated 358 patients over three years. Baseline demographic data were collected for patients undergoing elective and urgent procedures, and mortality outcomes at one-month, one-year and three-year follow-up were compared.<br><br>Urg-TAVI was required in 131 (36.6%) patients. Patients undergoing Urg-TAVI were significantly more likely to be female, have poor left ventricular (LV) function, with higher baseline creatinine and higher clinical frailty score (CFS). Higher rates of vascular complications were independently associated with increased mortality at one month. Mortality at one year was associated with higher creatinine level (odds ratio [OR] 1.01, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.00 to 1.01, p=0.0013) and an urgent procedure (OR 2.25, 95%CI 1.28 to 3.97, p=0.0048). There remained a higher mortality in the urgent patients at three-year follow-up.<br><br>In conclusion, undergoing TAVI urgently did not have a statistically significant effect on 30-day mortality. However, over long-term follow-up of one year, it was associated with worse mortality than elective TAVI, and this persisted out to three years.</pre><hr><figure class="post__image"><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://tavidoctor.com/media/posts/7/Screenshot-2025-03-28-at-1.24.03-PM.png" alt="The American Journal of Cardiology ®" width="303" height="100" sizes="(min-width: 37.5em) 1600px, 80vw" srcset="https://tavidoctor.com/media/posts/7/responsive/Screenshot-2025-03-28-at-1.24.03-PM-xs.png 384w, https://tavidoctor.com/media/posts/7/responsive/Screenshot-2025-03-28-at-1.24.03-PM-sm.png 600w, https://tavidoctor.com/media/posts/7/responsive/Screenshot-2025-03-28-at-1.24.03-PM-md.png 768w, https://tavidoctor.com/media/posts/7/responsive/Screenshot-2025-03-28-at-1.24.03-PM-lg.png 1200w, https://tavidoctor.com/media/posts/7/responsive/Screenshot-2025-03-28-at-1.24.03-PM-xl.png 1600w"></figure><figcaption><a href="https://www.ajconline.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The American Journal of Cardiology ®</a></figcaption></figure><h5 class="align-center">Vol. 222 - 1 Jul  2024</h5><p class="align-left"><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0002914924003217">Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement With the Navitor System: Real-World United Kingdom Experience</a></p><pre>The Navitor transcatheter <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/heart-valve" title="Learn more about heart valve from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages" class="topic-link">heart valve</a> (THV) is the latest iteration of the <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/percutaneous-aortic-valve" title="Learn more about Portico from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages" class="topic-link">Portico</a> self-expanding valve system.

Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging is increasingly being used in the assessment of HC; however, little is known about the relation between wall thickness measurements made by the 2 modalities. We sought to compare measurements made with echocardiography and CMR and to assess the impact of any differences on risk stratification using the current European Society of Cardiology guidelines. Maximum LV wall thickness measurements were recorded on 50 consecutive patients with HC. Sixty-nine percent of LV wall thickness measurements were recorded with echocardiography, compared with 69% from CMR (p &lt;0.001). There was poor agreement on the location of maximum LV wall thickness; weighted-Cohen's κ 0.14 (p = 0.036) and maximum LV wall thicknesses were systematically higher with echocardiography than with CMR (mean 19.1 ± 0.4 mm vs 16.5 ± 0.3 mm, p &lt;0.01, respectively); Bland-Altman bias 2.6 mm (95% confidence interval −9.8 to 4.6). Interobserver variability was lower for CMR (R<sup>2</sup> 0.67 echocardiography, R<sup>2</sup> 0.93 CMR). The mean difference in 5-year sudden cardiac death (SCD) risk between echocardiography and CMR was 0.49 ± 0.45% (p = 0.37). When classifying patients (low, intermediate, or high risk), 6 patients were reclassified when CMR was used instead of echocardiography to assess maximum LV wall thickness. These findings suggest that CMR measurements of maximum LV wall thickness can be cautiously used in the current European Society of Cardiology risk score calculations, although further long-term studies are needed to confirm this.</pre><hr><figure class="post__image"><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://tavidoctor.com/media/posts/7/Screenshot-2025-03-28-at-1.32.21-PM.png" alt="Journal of Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance" width="632" height="78" sizes="(min-width: 37.5em) 1600px, 80vw" srcset="https://tavidoctor.com/media/posts/7/responsive/Screenshot-2025-03-28-at-1.32.21-PM-xs.png 384w, https://tavidoctor.com/media/posts/7/responsive/Screenshot-2025-03-28-at-1.32.21-PM-sm.png 600w, https://tavidoctor.com/media/posts/7/responsive/Screenshot-2025-03-28-at-1.32.21-PM-md.png 768w, https://tavidoctor.com/media/posts/7/responsive/Screenshot-2025-03-28-at-1.32.21-PM-lg.png 1200w, https://tavidoctor.com/media/posts/7/responsive/Screenshot-2025-03-28-at-1.32.21-PM-xl.png 1600w"></figure><figcaption><a href="https://jcmr-online.biomedcentral.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="c-journal-title__text">Journal of Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance</span></a></figcaption></figure><h5 class="align-center">Vol. 19 - 5 Dec 2016</h5><p class="align-left"><a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12968-017-0381-3">Diagnostic performance of image navigated coronary CMR angiography in patients with coronary artery disease</a></p><pre class="c-article__sub-heading" data-test="abstract-sub-heading"><strong>Background</strong><br>The use of coronary MR angiography (CMRA) in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) remains limited due to the long scan times, unpredictable and often non-diagnostic image quality secondary to respiratory motion artifacts.

Structural, functional, and extravascular abnormalities of the microcirculation lead to CMD. CMD can present with symptoms suggestive of CAD, often in the absence of significant obstructive epicardial CAD. Conventional invasive angiography does not allow direct visualization of the microcirculation. Invasive indices, such as CBF and CFR, and non-invasive imaging modalities, such as CMR and PET, can be used to quantify absolute MBF and enable a direct and accurate assessment of coronary microvascular function. CMD appears to be more prevalent in women, typically presenting with symptoms of ischemia with unobstructed coronary arteries, and has a relatively unfavorable prognosis. CMD is classified clinically depending on the presence or absence of epicardial CAD, myocardial disease, or iatrogenic causes. Although invasive intracoronary techniques can be used to detect CMD, these cannot provide insight into the mechanisms involved in its pathogenesis. Imaging modalities such as CMR and cardiac PET are becoming indispensable tools in the evaluation of suspected CMD.</pre><hr><figure class="post__image"><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://tavidoctor.com/media/posts/7/Screenshot-2025-03-28-at-1.32.21-PM.png" alt="Journal of Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance" width="632" height="78" sizes="(min-width: 37.5em) 1600px, 80vw" srcset="https://tavidoctor.com/media/posts/7/responsive/Screenshot-2025-03-28-at-1.32.21-PM-xs.png 384w, https://tavidoctor.com/media/posts/7/responsive/Screenshot-2025-03-28-at-1.32.21-PM-sm.png 600w, https://tavidoctor.com/media/posts/7/responsive/Screenshot-2025-03-28-at-1.32.21-PM-md.png 768w, https://tavidoctor.com/media/posts/7/responsive/Screenshot-2025-03-28-at-1.32.21-PM-lg.png 1200w, https://tavidoctor.com/media/posts/7/responsive/Screenshot-2025-03-28-at-1.32.21-PM-xl.png 1600w"></figure><figcaption><div class="u-container"><div class="c-journal-header__inner"><p id="journalTitle" class="c-journal-title"><a href="https://jcmr-online.biomedcentral.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="c-journal-title__text">Journal of Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance</span></a></p></div></div></figcaption></figure><h5 class="align-center">Vol. 18 - 6 Jan 2016</h5><p class="align-left"><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1097664723061677">Combined high-resolution assessment of quantitative perfusion and late enhancement.

Additional research is required but in the meantime we recommend oxygen is prescribed according to current guidelines.</pre><hr><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://tavidoctor.com/media/posts/7/15408159-1600808650580.webp" alt="Pacing and Clinical Electrophysiology (PACE) Journal" width="600" height="69" sizes="(min-width: 37.5em) 1600px, 80vw" srcset="https://tavidoctor.com/media/posts/7/responsive/15408159-1600808650580-xs.webp 384w, https://tavidoctor.com/media/posts/7/responsive/15408159-1600808650580-sm.webp 600w, https://tavidoctor.com/media/posts/7/responsive/15408159-1600808650580-md.webp 768w, https://tavidoctor.com/media/posts/7/responsive/15408159-1600808650580-lg.webp 1200w, https://tavidoctor.com/media/posts/7/responsive/15408159-1600808650580-xl.webp 1600w"><figcaption><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/15408159" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pacing and Clinical Electrophysiology (PACE) Journal</a></figcaption></figure><h5 class="align-center">Vol. 36(2) - 21 Jan 2011</h5><p class="align-left"><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-8159.2010.03021.x" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Single Site Left Ventricular Pacing induced Dyssynchrony and Cardiomyopathy</a></p><pre>Single site left ventricular (LV) pacing in the absence of intrinsic ventricular activity can be as detrimental to LV function as right ventricular apical pacing.
